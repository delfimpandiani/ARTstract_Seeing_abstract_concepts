IBM Debater (R) – Concept Abstractness Dataset

The “Concept Abstractness Dataset” consists of three files:
- prediction_unigrams.csv
- prediction_bigrams.csv
- prediction_trigrams.csv

Each of these files consists of 100,000 concepts (Wikipedia article title) - unigrams, bigrams and trigrams -  with their abstractness score. 

- ‘Concept’ : the concept - title of Wikipedia article. 
- ‘Score’ : the abstractness score - the higher, the more abstract. 

A detailed description of the dataset creation can be found in the paper.
